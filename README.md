# 4chan Toolbox
## A toolkit for maximum trolling.

So we made this thing to help people learn programming languages and since
we\'re very close to 4chan\'s technology board (/g/) we decided that this should
contain stuff related to 4chan and/or /g/.

The structure of this repo is like this:

- a directory with the name of a programming language (e.g. `python/` or `ruby/`)
  - a bunch of scripts
  - a custom `LICENCE` file (optional - we're using GPLv3 by default on all projects (read the `NOTE` inside `LICENCE`))
- and `README.md` and `LICENCE`
  
Only two scripts/projects have been officially approved so far:

- the Dupechecker - which checks for duplicate files by calculating MD5 hashes and stuff and,
- the Scraper - which downloads images from any 4chan thread 

Those scripts should work pretty much the same way in every language - the point
is, that when somebody already knows one language it might be easier to learn the
other one by looking at the exact source in the two different languages.

Pretty much anyone can contribute - just run a pull request and if it fits with
the 4chantoolbox-guidelines it'll get merged in.
